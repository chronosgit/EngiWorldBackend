# EngiWorldBackend
Backend application for EngiWorld project

# How to use

1. Clone
2. If necessary, change PORT variable in app.js, so it matches your desired port
3. There is a chance that you will need MongoDB installed. If so, just install it OR comment everything related to mongodb in the application (if you don't need mongodb data)
4. Authentication logic depends on passing Bearer header in requests. We may change it later on any other logic
